    <blockquote>his missions, Tanjiro meets Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira, fellow survivors of the exam with
    whom he forms an unlikely team. <del>The group soon face off against a member of the Kizuki, but are ultimately
    outmatched; they are rescued by the Corps and brought back to headquarters.</del> <ins>There, the Kamado siblings partake in a
    council between Kagaya Ubuyashiki, the leader of the Demon Slayer Corps, and the Hashira, the Corps' most elite
    members, who do not believe that Nezuko should be allowed to live.</ins> However, Kagaya nonetheless manages to convince
    them to accept her. With this agreement, Tanjiro begins to work alongside the Hashira, where he encounters
    significantly more resistance from the demons.<q> Alongside the Hashira and Corps members, Tanjiro takes part in
    numerous harrowing battles against the Kizuki, which they survive by narrow margins.</q> During the fray, it is
    discovered that Nezuko is invulnerable to sunlight, a discovery that makes her the prime target of Muzan, who has
    long sought a way to overcome the sun and thus become the ultimate being.</blockquote>
